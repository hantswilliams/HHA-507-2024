# Homework Assignment: Dashboards with Streamlit

## Overview

In this assignment, you will enhance a Streamlit dashboard by updating and modifying example code from an existing repository. This hands-on project will help you gain experience with Streamlit by creating visualizations, adding text, and incorporating interactive components.

## Objectives

- Clone and deploy an existing Streamlit dashboard to Streamlit Cloud.
- Modify the dashboard with additional features and enhancements.
- Understand the deployment process and share your dashboard via a public URL.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone and Rename Repository

- **Fork** the following repository to your own GitHub account:
    - About forking: [github forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

  [https://github.com/hantswilliams/507-streamlit-demo](https://github.com/hantswilliams/507-streamlit-demo)

- Then **rename** your forked repository to `streamlit-dashboard-enhanced`.
- Clone or open the repository to your local machine or Google Colab, Google Cloud Shell, Github Codespaces, or any other development environment that you want to use. 

### 2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

- Sign up or log in to **[Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/signup)**.
- Deploy the cloned repository to Streamlit Cloud to ensure it runs correctly.
- Verify that your dashboard is accessible via a public URL.

### 3. Enhance the Dashboard

- Modify the dashboard code to include:

  - Additional **visualizations** and **figures**.
  - Descriptive **text** to explain your data and visualizations.
  - Interactive components like **widgets** (e.g., sliders, buttons, checkboxes).

- You may use any relevant datasets or APIs to enrich your dashboard.
- Ensure your dashboard is **informative**, **user-friendly**, and **visually appealing**.

### 4. Update Your Repository

- Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- In your repository's `README.md` file, include:

  - A brief description of your dashboard.
  - The public URL of your deployed Streamlit dashboard.

## Deliverables

- **GitHub Repository URL**

  - Submit the URL of your GitHub repository containing the modified dashboard code.

- **Deployed Dashboard URL**

  - Ensure the `README.md` file in your repository includes the public URL to your deployed Streamlit dashboard.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the **GitHub repository URL** to brigthtspace. 
- Your code should be well-documented with comments where necessary.
- The dashboard must be live and accessible at the time of grading.
